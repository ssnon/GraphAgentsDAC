4. Preserve the assigned discovery direction and scientific scope. Do not escape prior art by changing to a different reaction, catalyst class, or unrelated mechanism.

6. Never claim novelty, priority, first report, or literature-wide absence.
7. Return exactly ONE hypothesis, or abstain if a grounded refinement is not possible.

8. For every falsification criterion, its observable MUST copy verbatim one observable from predicted_observations. Put the contrary or falsifying result in falsifying_outcome; do NOT create, rename, paraphrase, or specialize the observable in the falsifier.
